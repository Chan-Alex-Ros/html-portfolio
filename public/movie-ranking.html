<h1>My Favorite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>A revenge movie about an ex hitman who was wanted to retire but came 
   out of retirement to seek revenge for his dog. This movie was great
   because of the amazing action scenes and its overpowered main protagonist.
</p>
<h3>A silent voice</h3>
<p>An anime about a deaf girl who was bullied in middle school. The bully grown 
   up to regret his decision and fate brought them back together. Amazing soundtrack
   and teardropping emotional scene between the two main characters.
</p>
<h3>Spiderman</h3>
<p>A guy got bitten by a radioactive spider which cause him to have super natural power
   of web slinging and spider sense. Every childhood movie and awesome web slinging scene
   that was revolutionary for a movie at that time.
